# Lab 4 - Regression Analysis with Regularization

## Purpose
This lab explores various regression techniques using the Diabetes dataset. The aim is to compare the effects of different regression models and understand how regularization helps mitigate overfitting.

## Key Insights
- Ridge and Lasso regression improve generalization compared to polynomial regression.
- Lasso performs feature selection by shrinking some coefficients to zero.
- Polynomial regression shows clear signs of overfitting at higher degrees.

## Challenges
- Selecting appropriate alpha values required experimentation.
- Visualizing polynomial predictions became less interpretable at high degrees.
